# χαρμολύπη (Charmolypi)
### Abstract
***χαρμολύπη*** is an interactive artistic experience aiming to explore the *beauty of closeness* in the context of human relationships. 

The loss of social connection often leads to feeling lonely and pained. Relationships are the expression of the choice to risk start losing something personal in exchange for making space for something enriching. 

Distance is hereby understood as solitude: individuals are self-contained beings when apart but when they choose to start getting closer to one another, an exchange gradually happens. This exchange will inevitably translate into the opening of their respective boundaries, sharing parts of themselves to receive something valuable in exchange. 

The intention behind this project is to explore and abractly represent what humans possess and can choose to share of themselves, enhancing the value of the enriching effect closeness in relationships has on the individual. 

The **final purpose** of the installation is for the user to perceive *human connection* as something *empowering* and *valuable* and to highlight the joy that comes from choosing to transition from solitude to community. Closeness, sharing and openness are all choices that the installation wants to promote and encourage.
